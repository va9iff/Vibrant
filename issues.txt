time variable bug with ui
	after pause, when we start,
	the start() will reset the time variable.

color, radius and live preview
	color and radius setter changes in the visual, ok.
	but as we call them in parent's constructor, it'll 
	use parent's values. and we cant preview normally.
	so, in the constructor, it won't call visual. no, maybe not.
	instead, lets use a refresh method. this will be called in
	start() and live preview.
	but cant have class `myClass{a=123; set a(value){}}` it is forbidden.
	so in new classes, we should set color with `static`.

live preview
	after typed in editor, it'll setTimeout preview() that will
	exec() and call all the dots refresh(). so colors, radius will be proper.
	when you press before preview() called, it will abort, start setTout again.


jumbled processes
	we have to divide processes, physics process and etc.
	everythink is on the process and now we can modify this.
	so we need to make it modular and modify what we want.

performance hit due to HTML Elements
	we don't use canvas. this css ways is so easy.
	but may hit the performance as they grow in count.
	but how will we make it like this?
		take the output element's offsetWidth and offsetHeight.
		resize canvas to this.
		fit canvas to cover #output.
		in process, just consider the origin.
		like add offsetWidth/2 to x.
